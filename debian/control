Description: C! development files
 Include files need for C! development.
 .
 C! is a collection of C++ utility libraries developed over the course
 of +10 years and several major C++ application development
 projects.  It should compile and run on Windows, Linux and OSX
 using a modern C++ compiler.
 .
 Many of the facilities of C! are geared towards cross-platform
 application development and providing basic services that most
 applications need such as a configuration system, run-time build
 information, logging facilities, threads, smart pointers, simple
 embedded scripting, etc.
 .
 C!'s philosophy is to create clean, simple, readable, modular and
 reusable code.  C! also encourages exception based error handling,
 and light use of C++ templates and C preprocesor macros.
 .
 C! "leans" on the venerable boost library but also reimplements
 several boost APIs which are considered by the author to be too
 template heavy, less readable or overly complicated in boost.
 .
 The code was developed on an as needed basis and was never intended to
 be any sort of grand unifying system for C++ application development.
 However, I hope you find many parts of the library useful in your C++
 development projects.
