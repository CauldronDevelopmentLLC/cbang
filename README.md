C!
=====

The C! or cbang library is a collection of C++ utility libraries
developed over the course of +10 years and several major C++
application development projects.  It should compile and run on
Windows, Linux and OSX using a modern C++ compiler.

Many of the facilities of C! are geared towards cross-platform
application development and providing basic services that most
applications need such as a configuration system, run-time build
information, logging facilities, threads, smart pointers, simple
embedded scripting, etc.

C!'s philosophy is to create clean, simple, readable, modular and
reusable code.  C! also encourages exception based error handling, and
light use of C++ templates and C preprocesor macros.

C! "leans" on the venerable boost library but also reimplements
several boost APIs which are considered by the author to be too
template heavy, less readable or overly complicated in boost.

The code was developed on an as needed basis and was never intended to
be any sort of grand unifying system for C++ application development.
However, I hope you find many parts of the library useful in your C++
development projects.

# Prerequisites
## General
  - A modern C++ compiler: GNU C++, Intel C++, MSVS
  - SCons      http://scons.org/
  - boost      http://www.boost.org/
  - openssl    http://www.openssl.org/ (optional)
  - ChakraCore https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/ (optional)
  - mariadb    https://mariadb.org/ (optional)

## Debug mode only

  - libbfd    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/bfd-2.9.1/html_mono/bfd.html
  - libiberty https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libiberty/

## Windows only
  - Winsock

## OS-X only
  - IOKit
  - CoreFoundation

## POSIX/Linux only
  - pthreads
  - libbfd (For debug mode only)

On Debian based systems the prerequisites can be installed with the following
command line:

    sudo apt-get install scons build-essential libssl-dev \
      libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
      libboost-regex-dev binutils-dev libiberty-dev libmariadbclient-dev git

Unfortunately, at this time, there is no ChakraCore package for Debian.  See
the build instructions below.

# Build

    cd cbang
    scons

There are a number of build options which can either be passed on the
command line to scons or place in a configuration file named
'options.py'.  These options are as follows:

  - debug                - Enable debugging
  - optimize             - Enable compiler optimizations
  - static               - Build a static library
  - shared               - Build a shared library
  - strict               - Enable strict checking
  - distcc               - Enable distcc distributed compile system
  - ccache               - Enable ccache caching compile system
  - backtrace_debugger   - Enable the printing backtraces

These options are enabled by setting them to 1.  For example:

    scons debug=1

## Build Warnings/Errors
If you get any build warnings, by default, the build will stop.  If you have
problems building, especially with warnings related to the boost library you
can ignore these warnings by building with `scons strict=0`.  This disables
strict checking.

# Testing the Build

You can testing C! by going to the *tests* directory in the root of the
cbang source tree, building the test programs and running the test harness:

    cd tests
    scons
    ./testHarness

# Troubleshooting

This section describes some common problems and their solutions.

## OpenSSL Library Less than v1.0.0

If you get an error about the openssl library version being too old then you
either need to upgrade your package or build openssl from source like this:

    wget http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1f.tar.gz
    tar xzvf openssl-1.0.1f.tar.gz
    cd openssl-1.0.1f
    ./config
    make
    export OPENSSL_HOME=$PWD

Then try building C!.

## Problems with Boost Library

There are many different versions of boost and some systems have broken
packages.  If you run into these problems you can try C! built-in boost
build system like this:

    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.tar.bz2
    tar xjvf boost_1_55_0.tar.bz2
    export BOOST_SOURCE=$PWD/boost_1_55_0

Then rebuild C! as above.  Other versions of boost greater or equal to 1.40
may also work.

## ChakraCore

You can either download a prebuilt ChakraCore or build it yourself.  Currently
we require a fork of ChakraCore which includes some fixes.

### Windows Binaries

You can find windows binaries of ChakraCore here:
https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/ChakraCore/releases/tag/v2.0.0.1

### Building ChakraCore

ChakraCore is the Javascript engine used by the Microsoft Edge browser.  It
is fast and Open-Source.  It has a simpiler API than Google's v8 which is
why we've switched to it.  Unfortunately there currently aren't any readily
available Debian packages for ChakraCore so you will have to build it from
source.

First make sure you have the prerequisites:

    sudo apt-get install -y cmake clang libunwind-dev libicu-dev

You need at least cmake 3.2 and clang 3.8.  If your system doesn't have these
then you need to build them from source.


First download the source code:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/ChakraCore.git

Then build it:

    cd ChakraCore
    ./build.sh --static -j 8

Next collect the various libraries it produces in to one:

    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp
    for i in $(find ../Build* -name \*.a); do
      ar x $i
    done
    ar rcs ../libChakraCore.a *.o
    cd ..
    rm -rf tmp

Now setup the environment so that the C! build system can find ChakraCore:

    export CHAKRA_CORE_HOME=$PWD
