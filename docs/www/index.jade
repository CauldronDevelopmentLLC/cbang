      h1 About C!
      p
        | The C! (aka C Bang or cbang) library is a collection of C++
        | utility libraries developed over the course of +10 years and
        | several major C++ application development projects. It should
        | compile and run on Windows, Linux and OSX using a modern C++
        | compiler.

      p
       | Many of the facilities of C! are geared towards
       | cross-platform application development and provide basic
       | services that most applications need such as a configuration
       | system, run-time build information, logging facilities, threads,
       | smart pointers, simple embedded scripting, etc.

      p
       | C!'s philosophy is to create clean, simple, readable,
       | modular and reusable code. C! also encourages exception based
       | error handling, and light use of C++ templates and C
       | preprocessor macros.

      p
        | C! "leans" on the venerable boost library but also
        | reimplements several boost APIs which are considered by the
        | author to be too template heavy, less readable or overly
        | complicated in boost.

      p
        | The code was developed on an as needed basis and was never
        | intended to be any sort of grand unifying system for C++
        | application development. However, I hope you find many parts of
        | the library useful in your C++ development projects.

      h1 Building C!
