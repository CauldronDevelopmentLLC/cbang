       *-----------------------------------------------------------------
       * Boolean Literals      |  'true' & 'false'    |  'True' & 'False'
       * Empty set literal     |  'null'              |  'None'
       * Trailing comma        |  not allowed         |  allowed
       * Single quoted strings |  not allowed         |  allowed
       * Unquoted names        |  not allowed         |  allowed
       *
       * Python also allows other forms of escaped strings.
       * Also note that Javascript is more permissive than JSON.
